# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

Performing an analysis on crowdfunding data to uncover trends.

### Purpose

Louise, a playwright, wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play 'Fever'. Her estimated budget for the play is over $10,000. As this is her first crowdfunding campaign, Louise has asked for a detailed analysis on other Kickstarters. The goal is to determine if there are certain factors that result in a successfully funded project, by analyzing the data through organizing and sorting.

## Analysis and Challenges

The data was analyzed using Excel, by using basic methods such as filtering to much more complicated methods like formulas. By organizing, sorting, and cleaning the data, pivot tables and charts were created to further assist in understanding the outcomes.

Properly inputting the formulas was a challenge that arose, as it was not always clear what the correct order or which data was required for the desired outcome. Although frustrating at first, this was easily overcome by quick searches done on google or using the help option in Excel itself.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Outcomes for crowdfunding projects sorted by launch date show that projects that started in May, June, and July had a higher success rate than those launched in other months. The following line chart provides a good visualization of the outcome. The chart also shows that although a similar number of projects were launched in September, October, and November, the highest number of failed projects occurred in October, despite there being no canceled projects during that month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

When looking at the data for project outcomes based on the goal, the chart below shows that projects with a goal less than or equal to $5000 had a higher success rate than most projects above that goal.

## Limitations and Recomendations

The Kickstarter data set provides a lot of useful information about how well or not so well campaigns did in raising enough money to meet their goals. One of things it lacks is the ability to determine public interest in Louise's play specifically, this limitation could potentially lead to a failed campaign even if she reduced the budget and launched during a month that was otherwise full of successful projects.

Other useful tables and graphs could be ones that look at the number of backers per campaign or the average amount of donations to determine how many people Louise would potentially have to reach out to for a successful outcome. A chart that looks at the length of successful campaigns could also be useful in setting up an ideal deadline.
