# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

Performing an analysis on crowdfunding data to uncover trends.

### Purpose

Louise, a playwright, wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play 'Fever'. Her eastimated budget for the play is over $10,000. As this is her first crowdfunding campaign, Louise has asked for a deatailed analysis on other Kickstarters. The goal is to determine if there are certain factors that result in a successfully funded project, by analyzing the data through organizing and sorting.

## Analysis and Challenges

The data was analyzed using Excel, by using basic methods such as filtering to much more complicated methods like formulas. By organizing, sorting, and cleaning the data, pivot tables and charts were created to further assist in understanding the outcomes.

Properly inputting the formulas was a challenge that arose, as it was not always clear what the correct order or which data was required for the desired outcome. Although frustraing at first, this was easily overcome by quick searches done on google or using the help option in Excel itself.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Outcomes for crowdfunding projects sorted by launch date show that projects that starterd in May, June, and July had a higher success rate than those launched in other months. The following line chart provides a good visualization of the outcome. The chart also shows that although a similar number of projects were launched in September, October, and Novermber, October has no canceled projects but the highest failed projects from the 3 months.
